# RiffViewer

## What is it ? 
Riff stands for "*Resource Interchange File Format*". It is a generic file format used to store data seperated in chunks. 
You can easily know more with the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Interchange_File_Format).

Riff file format has a well known viewer that has been here for a long time : [Riffpad](https://www.menasoft.com/blog/?p=34) but I wanted to do mine (and improve it).

## How to build
The building files are generated by [premake](https://premake.github.io/) using the description file located inside *Scripts* folder.
You can use the pre-made scripts located inside the same directory to generate the executable.
